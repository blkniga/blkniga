    <h3>Hello World! ðŸ‘‹</h3>

    I am Bulelani Botman, a student from the Vaal University of Technology studying towards a diploma in IT. I am a person who loves to learn and expand my knowledge in the software development realm. I love backend development and open source software / projects. I am very much interested and would love to contribute more to open source.

    I am currently studying towards my diploma (graduating this year April.) I am also a student at ALX Africa and I am enrolled in Software Development course (which will end this year July)
